**Purpose of the Repository**


The aim of this project is to predict match outcomes of football matches, based on historical data that includes basic match data and FIFA ranking. In attempting to solve this problem, the analyst will perform;

* Feature transformation and dimensionality reduction techniques so as to increase the quality of the feature space.
* Compare multiple classification algorithms and choose the one that performs best on a separate test dataset.
* Finally apply probability calibration methods based on isotonic regression to increase the quality of class probability estimates.

**Success Metrics**

* Sucessful Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Sucessful feature engineering.
* Sucessful check of multicollinearity.
* Sucessful modeling.
* Sucessful Cross-validation of the model.
* Sucessful Computation of the RMSE
* Creation of residual plots for the model
* Sucessful assessment their heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test
